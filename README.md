# MinecraftAi
Random programming to try to make a minecraft AI

Current functionality:
-brach mines when ran
-requires minecraft bedrock to be fourth window in windows 10 hotbar
-player must already be facing directly forward with pickaxe in slot 1 of inventory and torches in slot 2
-chest must be directly behind player
-stand with a wall in front of you that you want to mine

issues:
-right and left turns aren't exact so get out of sync in long mining proccesses
-mouse movement is based on screen resolution pixels (I think) so it may not work on all computers
